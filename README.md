Improve your spreadsheets by inserting 8 bits Super Mario all over the place

You can insert the script from code.gs in any of your Google Apps Script, as long as it's bound to  a Spreadsheet. 

From there you can insert Marios in two simple steps : 
1. Select a cell in your spreadsheet, this will become the top left corner of your 8 bit Mario
2. From the new custom menu "Misc", press "Insert an 8-bit Mario"

And then Mario appears.
